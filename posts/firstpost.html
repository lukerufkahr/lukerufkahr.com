<p>
	This is the first post on this website. More to come...
	My next goal is to make a post writing tool. I will write it in python because that is what we are using in class.
</p>
<p>
	Why did I code the site this way? It would definitely be easier in the long run to use a SSG like <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>
	or something like Squarespace but I wanted something that was mine so I initially was going to go the route of writing HTML files by hand
	and copy and pasting things like the nav bar and the footer and updated everything manually but that was too much of a pain so I decided
	that I wanted only the things I wanted to change to change. Apparently there are things that can do that like jQuery and stuff like Angular
	which I haven't really looked into all that much but honestly, I try and stay away from using libraries and other people's code as much 
	as I can. I find it more fulfilling to create myself without having to rely too much on the work others.
